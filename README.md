> DeepLab V3


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Create a fresh eviornment using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution. You can then install the dependencies with:
```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
conda install opencv=4.1.2
conda install matplotlib
```
Recommended python version: 3.7

## üíæ Cityscapes Training Data

The dataset required for training and evalution can be downloaded using 
```shell
sh utils/download_dataset.sh
```
_YOUR_USER_NAME_ and _YOUR_PASSWORD_ in the script should be replaced with the users credentials.
